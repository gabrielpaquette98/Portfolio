                Surfpunk is a PvE co-op extraction ARPG by <a href="https://dblstallion.com/">Double Stallion Games</a>, where players explore island-filled worlds and gather resources 
                as daring raiders. When I joined the project, the team was transitioning to 3D, and my primary mission was to translate the studio's 
                distinctive 2D style into 3D while preserving the essence of a "Double Stallion game." Early in development, the game pivoted from 
                a 2D platformer to a top-down perspective, giving me the opportunity to contribute to a variety of systems over nearly two years. 
                My work included cel-shading for characters and environments, water effects, outlines, artist tools, and more!

                <h3>Cel Shading and Decals</h3>
                <p>
                    My first task was creating a shader to replicate Double Stallion's signature aesthetic. This shader utilizes a gradient texture to 
                    adjust how lighting affects shading, allowing seamless transitions from smooth to cel-shaded effects. It supports multiple features 
                    such as specular highlights, rim lights, emissive textures, and outline options. Depending on whether the object is a character or 
                    an environmental element, additional techniques ‚Äîlike triplanar texturing, silhouette shading, vertex displacement for ink effects 
                    on enemies, and wind effects‚Äî are applied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, I developed a decal shader variant of the main cel shader. Using the depth buffer, it recalculates where the position 
                    in world space is, which allows for decals. The same code is reused for some visual effects that use different shaders made 
                    specifically for those effects. They are animated by sending the current time and the starting time of the effect to the 
                    effect's shader.

                <h3>Water, Foam and Waves</h3>
                <p>
                    Water was a significant focus during my time on Surfpunk. I implemented many things, such as caustics, refraction, and 
                    depth-based recoloring of submerged objects. I was allowed a lot of liberty on how it looks!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the low-amplitude <b>waves</b> (seen in the first video), a big focus was put on making them readable and predictable. 
                    All the connected players needed to have the same waves, and these waves needed to be visually impactful while minimally 
                    affecting player movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tackling <b>intersection foam</b> presented an interesting challenge. A popular way to do this is to use the depth buffer: 
                    recolor the objects that are under the water, and make them into foam if they are close to the surface. A problem with this 
                    approach is that it can only place foam on top of objects. If you were to look at a building from the side, the foam wouldn't 
                    extrude as expected. To fix this, I came up with a few solutions, most important of which was to bake an intersection texture 
                    to identify where the objects intersect with the water, and add to that texture the distance from the intersection. The result 
                    is exaggerated on the gif that shows the paddles of the ship, I got to generate those automatically from the model given by 
                    our environment artist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the <b>tsunami wave</b> appearing at the level's conclusion, I created a designer-friendly system based on a modifiable curve. 
                    This curve drives gameplay mechanics and vertex displacement of a plane, augmented by a secondary foam model. The wave's shading 
                    adheres to the water's overall principles.

                <h3>Procedural Generation</h3>
                <p>
                    When given the chance to select my own tasks for a sprint, I prototyped a system for procedural island generation. Designed as an 
                    editor tool, this system generates island terrain by generating first a grid of triangles and squares to deform tiles, producing varied islands 
                    from minimal input. Inspired by <a href="https://x.com/osksta?lang=en">Oskar St√•lberg</a>'s work, this approach offers a starting 
                    point for designers to iterate and expand on, instead of his focus on producing a complete result at runtime.

                <h3>Outlines and Selection Outline</h3>
                <p>
                    Outlines, another early challenge, required a blend of techniques to achieve consistent results. The primary method involved rendering 
                    object IDs to a buffer for post-processing. Differences in this buffer generated outline pixels, with optional depth and normal-based 
                    enhancements in specific scenarios. This ID-based technique gave the most reliable results and became the foundation for the project's outlines.

                <h3>Texture Painting and Texture Blending</h3>
                <p>
                    To streamline texture painting on environment objects, I developed a tool allowing artists to paint directly in-engine, enabling 
                    real-time feedback with level props like grass and trees that would be tedious to set up in the artist's modeling software. The 
                    tool detects the cursor's location on objects and applies RGBA channel-based texture painting, and the resulting texture is sent 
                    to the shader where the textures are blended accordingly.

                <h3>Inverse Kinematics and Legs Management</h3>
                <p>
                    For animating the enemies walk cycle, I used Unity's Animation Rigging Package to create a procedural system for enemy foot placement. 
                    This solution calculates foot positions dynamically, allowing enemies to decide when to step. It integrates with the packages' IK 
                    solver to ensure smooth animations while reducing animator workload. In this example, the animator only needed to animate parts of 
                    the model and let the root and the feet still. The feet and the body are then moved by my code, and it uses the distance from the 
                    animation poses to determine when to take steps.

                <p>
                    Of these other contributions, I am most proud of the Sumi oil shader shown in the first three gifs. I got full liberty on how it should look, 
                    and came up with this result by using noise to sample noise. We needed something that the player would immediately identify to the enemies of the game, 
                    which are based on oil and ink. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also atmospheric effects, which changes colors based on the depth of the camera's view allowing for fog, weather presets that 
                    changes the feel of a specific run of the game, tests for code to make clouds and the skybox, blending the grass and environment objects, 
                    volumetric lights, and also wind by moving vertices.
