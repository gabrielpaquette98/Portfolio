                Surfpunk is a PvE co-op extraction ARPG by <a href="https://dblstallion.com/">Double Stallion Games</a>, 
                where players are raiders in a world filled with islands to explore and resources to collect. 
                I arrived on the project when 3D was still very new for the team, and my main mandate was to port the studio's style from 2D to 
                3D while keeping it looking like a Double Stallion game. The game then pivoted from 2D platforming gameplay to a top-down view, 
                and over almost two years I got to tackle many subjects, such as the cel-shading for character and environments, the water, the 
                outlines, tools for the artists and many more!

                <h3>Cel Shading and Decals</h3>
                <p>
                    My first task was to make a shader to replicate the signature look and feel of Double Stallion's previous games. It uses a gradient 
                    texture for how the lights affect the shading so it's easy for an object to go from a smoother shading to a cel shading. It supports 
                    many features, such as specular highlights, rim lights, additional lights, emissive textures and options for outlines within a single 
                    object. Some features depend on if the object is a character or an environment object, including triplanar texturing, texture 
                    blending, silhouette shading, vertex displacement for an ink effect on the enemies, and wind. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later on, I added a Decal shader as a variant of the main cel shader. Using the depth buffer, it recalculates where the position 
                    in world space is, which allows for decals. The same code is reused for some visual effects that uses different shaders made 
                    specifically for those effects. They are animated by sending the current time and the starting time of the effect to the 
                    effect's shader.

                <h3>Water, Foam and Waves</h3>
                <p>
                    Water was one of my main focus during my time on Surfpunk. I implemented many things, such as caustics, refraction, and 
                    recoloring based on how deep into the water the objects are. I was allowed a lot of liberty on how it looks!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the low-amplitude <b>waves</b> in the first video, a big focus was put on making them readable and predictable. 
                    All the connected players needed to have the same waves, and the waves needed to be visible but small enough to not 
                    move the players too much.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>intersection foam</b> is always an interesting challenge to tackle. A popular way to do this is to use the depth buffer: recolor
                    the objects that are under the water, and make them into foam if they are close to the surface. A problem with this approach is that
                    it can only place foam on top of objects. If you were to look at a building from the side, the foam wouldn't extrude as expected.
                    To fix this, I came up with a few solutions, most important of which was to bake an intersection texture to identify where the objects
                    intersects with the water, and add to that texture the distance from the intersection. The result is exagerated on the gif that shows 
                    the paddles of the ship, I got to generate those automatically from the model given by our environment artist. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>tsunami wave</b> happens at the end of the level. At its core, it is a curve that
                    a designer can modify, which is then used in gameplay to tell where the player should be, and that same curve is baked to a texture 
                    which is used to displace the vertices of a plane to make the wave. Another model is added on top for the foam, and the general shading 
                    of the wave follows the same principles as the water.

                <h3>Procedural Generation</h3>
                <p>
                    When allowed to pick my own task for a sprint, I decided to focus on making a prototype to generate islands for Surfpunk. The idea
                    was to have something that can be expanded upon, so I set out to generate the ground for islands and for this to be usable by 
                    designers as a first rough pass. As you can see in the gif, it uses very few tiles and generates very varied shapes. This is thanks 
                    to the grid used to place the tiles, which is comprised of triangles and squares, and it deforms the tiles to fit the grid. It is 
                    heavily inspired by the work of <a href="https://x.com/osksta?lang=en">Oskar St√•lberg</a>, except this approach was intended for use 
                    as an editor tool instead of full runtime generation.

                <h3>Outlines and Selection Outline</h3>
                <p>
                    The outlines were one of my first challenges as a graphics programmer on this project, after making the cel shading. In the end, I used 
                    many different techniques, but the most important one is showed in the gifs. An ID is calculated for each object, and rendered to a buffer 
                    which is then used to make the outlines in a post processing pass. Any difference in this buffer, given some parameters, will generate 
                    an outline pixel. I also used the depth and the normals of the objects to make outlines in some situations, but using IDs gave the most 
                    consistent results and quickly became the main technique for the outlines in this project.

                <h3>Texture Painting and Texture Blending</h3>
                <p>
                    I made this tool to help artists with painting textures. Of course, it is entirely possible to paint this way in other software, but our 
                    level pipeline was in Unity, so painting in the engine was needed in order to have the extra props such as grass or trees during the painting. 
                    As for how it works, it detects where to cursor is on the object, and paints a texture based on the texture coordinates that the cursor 
                    picked up. It paints in RGBA channels individually and this texture is then given to the ground's shader where the ground textures are 
                    blended accordingly.

                <h3>Inverse Kinematics and Legs Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Using Unity's Animation Rigging Package, I made a solution to calculate where the feet should be at any given time. The enemies in Surfpunk 
                    can then choose for themselves if they should take a step or not, my solution decides where the feet are and the package's IK solver places 
                    the bones accordingly. In this gif, the animator only needed to animate parts of the model and let the root and the feet still. The feet and 
                    the body are then moved by my code, and it uses the distance from the animation poses to determine when to take steps.

                <p>
                    Of these, I am most proud of the Sumi oil shader shown in the first three gifs. I got full liberty on how it should look, and came up with 
                    this result by using noise to sample noise. We needed something that the player would immidiately identify to the enemies of the game, 
                    which are based on oil and ink. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also atmospheric effects, which changes colors based on the depth of the camera's view allowing for fog, weather presets that 
                    changes the feel of a specific run of the game, tests for code to make clouds and the skybox, blending the grass and environment objects, 
                    volumetric lights, and also wind by moving vertices.
